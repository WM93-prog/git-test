creating links in html.

using an anchor element <a>href="destination"</a> will create a clickable link

to open link in a new tab add

target="_blank"

if this is left out the link will take on the value of _self and open in current tab. 

for added security and anti phising properties add(describes the relationship between the html page and the document):


rel="noopener noreferrer"

noopener= value prevents the document page being opened from accessing the page from whcih it was opened.

noreferrer= value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or 'reference') to it. 

they share similar attributes can be used by themselves but good to know both.


they help with to prevent phishing attacks.

its recommended to match target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferre"

final code:

<a>href="destination" target="_blank" ref="noopener no referrer"</a>
